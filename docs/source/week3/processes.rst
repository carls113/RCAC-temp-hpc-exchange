Managing processes
==================
:doc:`week3`

**Previous section:**
:doc:`scripts`

There are many things we can do to
manage processes in the shell:

* Run more than one program by placing it in the background
* Query running processes
* Interrupt or re-attach to background processes
* Wait nicely for background processes to finish

To run programs in the background, add
a single trailing ampersand (&) to the
command.

.. code-block::

   $ sleep 600 &
   [1] 1298141

   $ echo "still here"
   still here

Output from these "background-ed"
programs is still streamed to the shell.
But you can still interact with the
shell while the background processes
are going.

.. hint::
   
   After the program is put in the
   background, the shell tells you
   two numbers. The first number is
   the relative process ID (PID),
   relative to the number of child
   processes. The second number is
   the system PID.

You can check on your shell's
child processes with the `jobs`
program.

.. code-block::

   $ jobs
   [1]+  Running      sleep 600 &

You can also check on ALL
running processes with the `ps`
command.

.. code-block::

   $ ps -u username
   PID     TTY     TIME   CMD
   221965 ?      00:00:00 systemd
   221967 ?      00:00:00 (sd-pam)
   221972 ?      00:00:00 sshd
   221973 pts/10 00:00:00 bash
   222170 pts/10 00:00:00 sleep
   222182 pts/10 00:00:00 ps

Quiz: What does the `-u` option
do?

   It restricts the output to only
   show jobs from that one user.

You can wait nicely for all jobs
in the background to complete with
the `wait` program. You can also
re-attach to background processes
with the `fg` program. Lastly, you
can interrupt proccesses with the
`kill` command (using \% for the
relative PID).

.. code-block::

   $ wait
   
   $ sleep 600 &
   [1] 222728

   $ kill -s int %1

.. hint::

   If you don't want to wait for a
   program to finish normally, you
   can send an interrupt signal with
   your keyboard. For Linux and Windows
   users, you press *Ctrl + c* and for
   Mac users, you press *Cmd + .*.

Once you send a program to the
background, you can pull it back to
the foreground by using the `fg` program::

   $ sleep 600 &
   [1] 222747

   $ fg %1

This code will bring the `sleep 600`
program back to the foreground and
will wait for it to finish before
giving you back control of the
command line.

The `kill` program can technically
send any signal to a program (despite
its ominous name). In the example above,
we have sent the `int` signal to the
first child process. This interrupts
the process and tries to stop it.

The UNIX *signal interrupt* mechanism is
an important concept to understand in
software programming. You should know
about the **SIGNINT**, **SIGTERM**, and
**SIGKILL** signals, which are all
interrupt signals with increasing amounts
of force to the program.

However, there are many other sigals with
different purposes other than to halt a
process.

Slurm understand signals and can send
desired signals to your job script or
steps at predefined times (e.g. 10 minutes
before the walltime limit).
