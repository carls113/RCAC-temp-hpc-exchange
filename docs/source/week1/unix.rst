The Unix Operating System
-------------------------

Unix is a broad family of multitasking, multi-user operating systems,
stemming from the original AT\&T Unix, developed by Bell Labs in the
early 1970s. It is often associated with its rich tradition with
command-line environments, the UNIX "shell", and the C-programming
language.

Unix can also refer to a trademark, where other operating must
conform to a certain set of standards to be considered a "UNIX"
operating system.

Unix has many different variants:

* Genetic UNIX (such as FreeBSD)
* Branded UNIX (such as macOS)
* Functional UNIX (such as Linux)

Genetic UNIX means that the operating system can directly trace
its lineage back to the original Unix operating systems from the
70s. Branded UNIX is an operating system that has paid to have
the trademark of UNIX bestowed upon it, and has to fit a set of
standards to be considered such. Lastly, functional UNIX refers
to operating systems that follow the same standards as UNIX and
look/feel like UNIX, but do not pay to have the same trademark.

Why Unix?
---------

There are many reasons why one would want to use a UNIX operating
system for servers (both in HPC and Cloud scenarios).

* Performance
* Compatibility
* Configurability
* Multi-user
* Cost
* Programming environment

Firstly, UNIX systems are usually lightweight, meaning they
don't have all the features that many modern operating systems
have, which means that they can run much faster than other
operating systems out there.

Next, many different applications and libraries are compatible
with UNIX systems, meaning that a lot of different workflows
can be run on a UNIX system.

UNIX systems also often offer much more flexibility when it
comes to the system configuration, allowing the system to be
adapted to a plethora of different use cases.

One of the most important aspects of UNIX systems is that they
are multi-user, or multiple users can use the system at the
same time. Imagine if supercomputers were limited to one user
at a time\! Science would grind to a halt very quickly.

UNIX systems are also often cheaper, or even free, than their
counterparts, which is valuable in an enterprise situation,
where you may have thousands of users.

Lastly, UNIX systems often have primarily text-based interfaces,
as opposed to GUI-based ones such as Microsoft Windows. In
addition, there are many compilers and libaries that are needed
for scientific programming that are readily available for UNIX
systems, such as **MPI** and **BLAS** implemetations.

Unix components
---------------

UNIX systems are typically made up of three main components
that we will discuss in the following text. The three
components are:

* The File system hierarchy standard
* The Executable and library format
* The shell

File system hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In UNIX systems, there is a conventional layout of the
file system directories. And there are repeated structures in
different places in the file system. There are standard
structures, names and purposes for different directories.
Some names exist only at the root of the file system and others
are repeated in layers for a similar purpose or function.
Some common directories you may see are:

* **/bin** - where binaries and executables go
* **/share** - where application specific data goes
* **/lib** - includes the libraries necessary for the binaries
* **/etc** - often contains system configuration files

Other top-level directories that you would commonly see are:
**/boot, /dev, /sys, /proc, /mnt, /tmp** and others.

**Everything is a file**

In UNIX, everything is a file. This is an important and infamous
tradition within UNIX systems. System configurations that may be
an "API" on other operating systems are just plain text files.
Inter-process communications are text as well. Even device
interfaces, such as your screen, or your mouse are exposed via
the file system. Even "non-file" things are files. Open/close
read/write, seek, etc. are the universal way to control
everything on UNIX systems, such as devices, system interfaces,
processes, peripherals and other non-file things.

**Metadata**

Because everything is a file, metadata about those files can be
very important. It is important for the file system to know who
owns the file and which group(s) can access that file. Each file
also has multiple timestamps that record when the file was
created and when it was last edited.

Executables and libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In UNIX systems, since everything is a file, it needs to know
which files it can run and while files binaries need to be
able to run. These are referred to as executables (files
that can be run) and libraries (files needed for the executables
to run).

The shell
^^^^^^^^^

Last, but not least, the way to interact with the file system
that contains everything about the systems is via the "shell".
We will talk about the shell more in the next section, but for
now, it is sufficient to say that it is the text-based
interface to interact with UNIX systems.
