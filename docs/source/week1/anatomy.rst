Anatomy of a command
====================
:doc:`week1`

**Previous section:**
:doc:`shell`

In the shell, there are two types of programs: built-in and installed.
There is a slight, but important, distinction between the two:
built-in programs usually come with the operating system, and installed
programs are added externally after the operating system is set up.
They can both usually be run the same way, by typing their name
into the shell, but there are some caveats that we will go over in
:doc:`../week3/week3`.

Every command has a common anatomy that follows a similar pattern
every time. There are three parts to a command:

#. The program
#. The options
#. The argument(s)

Here is an example of a copy command\:::

   $ cp --verbose -r example-data data.bak

Again, the $ is the end of the prompt, showing that we are using
the shell to type in our command. It starts with the program, which
in this example is `cp`. This program copies data from one location
to another. Next comes the options, which modify the behavior of the
program. In our example, we have specified two options: `verbose`
and `r`. `verbose` is a long form option and thus requires two leading
dashes. It tells the command to print out more information about what
it is doing. `r` is a short form option, using a single letter, and
requires a single leading dash. It stands for *recursive*, which tells
the copy command to recurse into directories and copy all the files
within those directories.

.. caution::
   
   Not all options are the same in different programs, some may even
   mean completely different things for different programs. Excercise
   caution and look at the manual pages for each program to make sure
   you understand what each option does.

As the last part of the command, we have the argument(s). These tell
the program what to operate on. This could be a file, a directory,
a database, etc. Some programs don't require any arguments and others
need a specific number of arguments to work. In the copy example,
`example-data` is the directory we want to copy and `data.bak` is the
location we want to copy it to. 

As mentioned earlier, some options are unsupported for different programs.
Some programs will be helpful and tell you that the option is invalid.
Others will silently fail and you will be left wondering why.::

   $ cp -z example-data data.bak
   cp: invalid option -- 'z'
   Try 'cp --help' for more information.

Another problem you may run into is a `command not found` error. This
happens when the computer doesn't know where to find the program you
are trying to run\:::

   $ blah
   -bash: blah: command not found

We will go over strategies to overcome this error in the
:doc:`../week3/week3` section\: :doc:`../week3/scripts`.
