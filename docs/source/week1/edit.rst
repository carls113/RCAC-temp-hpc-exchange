Editing files from the command line
===================================

Filename hygiene
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a system where everything is a file, filenames are
important. It is important to know some common pitfalls
when naming files on UNIX systems. The biggest one is
that spaces are frowned upon. The command line sees
whitespace as delineating the arguments of a program.
So, if you had a folder named `example data`, and ran
this command:

.. code-block::

   $ ls example data

It would try to list everything in the `example` and
`data` directories, not your correct folder with a
space in it. If you absolutely must have a space
or another special character in your file's name,
you can escape it by using the escape character (\\)
to tell the command line to take that character as
is and not try to interpret it. So you could do

.. code-block::

   $ ls example\ data

And that would list the contents of the `example data`
directory.

A couple of other so-called *special* characters
include \*, \$, \#, \~. This is by no means an exhaustive
list, but you can search `bash special characters` to
see more of what would not be a good idea to include
in a file name.

A safe practice is to stick to letters, numbers,
underscores and dashes in your file names.

Command line editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, we want to edit files, but we don't have a graphical
editor, like Microsoft Word, so how do we accomplish
this? We use a command line editor! It essentially
turns your command line into a file editor. There are
many different command line editors, such as `vim`,
`emacs`, and `nano`. In this series, we will focus on
using the `nano` editor. It is the most beginner
friendly.

.. _nano:

nano
^^^^

To start `nano` you can do one of two ways:

Simply type `nano` to start it in a new file:

.. code-block::

   $ nano

Or provide a file name to start editing that file:

.. code-block::

   $ nano document.txt

Nano looks similar to this:

.. code-block::
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 6, 7

   GNU nano 2.9.8 		document.txt		 Modified

   It’s not "publish or perish" anymore,
   it’s "share and thrive".

   ^G Get Help ^O Write Out ^W Where Is ^K Cut Text   ^J Justify
   ^X Exit     ^R Read File ^\ Replace  ^U Uncut Text ^T To Spell

Where the first line is just the title of the editor.
The next lines are the text of the document. And the
last two lines are the commands that you can run, by
pressing the `control` key plus the character shown
in the help.

To type in the document, simply start typing and it
will put it into the file. Note that you cannot use
your mouse to navigate around the file, it can only
use your arrow keys to move the cursor.

The two `control` commands that you will probably use
the most are the `Write Out` and `Exit` commands.
`Write Out` saves the file to the file name that you
specify and `Exit` quits out of the editor.

.. _mv:

mv
^^

Once you have a file to play around with, we can
run some special programs using the file. The first
of these is the `mv` program, which stands for `move`.
It takes two arguments to run: a source and a destination.

The `mv` program can change the name of a file, or it can
move the file to a different directory. So, the source is
what file you want to modify and the destination is either
the name of the file you want to change it to, or if it's
a directory, it's the place you want to put the file.

Changing the name of the file:

.. code-block::

   $ mv document.txt paper.txt

Which will change the name of the file to be `paper.txt`

Changing the location of the file:

.. code-block::

   $ mv paper.txt ~/example-data/

Which will move the file into the `example-data`
directory, but keep the same name.

.. _cp:

cp
^^

The `cp` or `copy` program is similar to the `mv` program
except that it leaves the original copy intact. This is
useful if you want to create a backup or a fork of
something. The command:

.. code-block::

   $ cp ~/example-data/paper.txt ~/thesis.txt

Will copy the `paper.txt` file data from the *example-data*
directory into the new file `thesis.txt`, in the home
directory, but still keep the original file around.

Let's try backing up a directory:

.. code-block::

   $ cp example-data/ data.bak
   cp: example-data/ is a directory (not copied).

Oops, what happened here?

.. admonition:: Answer
   :collapsible: closed

   We can't copy directories without recursively copying
   its contents, with the `-r` option.

.. _rm:

rm
^^

The most powerful and respect-worthy program we will
talk about in this series is the `rm` program. It
removes or `unlinks` files and directories. On UNIX systems,
there is no concept of a trash bin, if you remove a file,
it's gone forever, no way to get it back. So make sure
you know what you're deleting before you run the program.

.. code-block::

   $ rm thesis.txt

To delete directories, you need to use the `-r` or
recursive option. This will delete the directory and
everything inside of it. Again, this is permanent, so
be very careful to know exactly what you're deleting.

.. code-block::

   $ rm -r data.bak
